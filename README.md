It's a digital tracking sheet that will organize your game cards and do all of the maths for you

It's also... very barebones.

If you want to use this for a game, it's ideal to use VS Code extension ritwickdey.LiveServer and
set liveServer.settings.useLocalIp to true - this will allow anyone on the wifi you're using to
access the tracking sheet themselves, and each player's gameplay is saved in localStorage (so don't
start cleaning your browser mid-game)
